# Room Management and Delivery Management System (RMDMS)

This project is inspired by a service I encountered that offers a wide range of features.  
For this implementation, I’ve chosen to focus on just one core feature to deepen my understanding by building it from scratch.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### ✅ Currently Using
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Kotlin)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (running in a Docker container)

### 🚀 Planned for Later
- **Firebase**

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Authentication** – Secure login and registration system
- 🔑 **Authorization** – Role-based access for:
    - Manager
    - Owner
    - Tenant
- 🏠 **Room Management** – Create, update, and manage room details
- 👤 **User Management** – Manage user roles and information
- 📦 **Parcel Management** – Track and handle parcel deliveries for tenants
